Notes on using this messy game:

In unreal, run this in VR mode, two-player networked

Setting up world boundaries:
When the game first starts (ie first run from Unreal), click the VR controller trigger in each corner of your play/chaperone area,
going either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Then click the trigger anywhere on the ground. This will
establish the bounds for the game, and it will largely stay confined within.

Startup glitch:
Sometimes when the game first starts, the Runner gets thrown far off the starting platform.
The game will reset and this will happen a few times until he's finally stable.

Runner first move:
The world is misrepresented at first from the Runner's view. He should run straight towards the red box outline,
and that will land him on the first platform. After that everything should be good.

God beacon:
The god also can place beacons by clicking the left thumbpad button on the VR controller.

Yellow platforms:
When a platform turns yellow, it will disappear in 10 seconds.
